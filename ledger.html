            <h2 class="title">The Task</h2>
            <p class="mb-5">I was tasked with solving an issue of disorganized and fragmented budget and sales records by creating a centralized
                location for business-critical information to be stored and retrieved. My solution was to create a web application that would serve
                as an employee portal, as this would allow all employees to access and edit records concurrently and from anywhere in the world.
            </p>
            <h2 class="title">The Solution &nbsp;<span style="font-size: 14px;"><a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/anthonyvittoria/ledger">See the Code <i class="fab fa-github"></i></a></span></h2>
            <p>I created a Django web application and designed the architecture to best accommodate the requirements of my task. This meant that
                there needed to be support for many customers that fall under different sectors and are located in many regions of the world. The
                application used a MySQL database for data storage and was deployed on Microsoft Azure.
            </p>
            <p>I designed a number of different views to represent the types of reports that my employer needed to run. These reports applied various filters to
                the collected data based on fields like year, quarter, plant location, customer region, and customer sector.

            </figure>
            <p>Each generated report allowed users to export the results in various formats, including copying all cell values to clipboard, generating an
                Excel spreadsheet, and printing the result table. Each report also included a search bar so that specific rows can be easily found from 
                large result tables.
